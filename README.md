# Vulnerability-Management-with-Nessus

Summery:

I conducted vulnerability assessment on Windows 10 VM through Nessus Essential for any vulnerability and attempted to remediate high critical vulnerability.

Download links:

Windows 10 ISO: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10

Nessus Essential: https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials

# Installing Nessus Essential

Once Nessus Essential finishes downloading, it will automatically open Nessus Essential on the browser. I directed to the link to initialize and create account:

After finishing creating the Nessus account, I tested if I can ping Windows 10 VM from my personal desktop.

To ping the VM IP address continually by command: “ping <ip address> -t” from my computer’s command prompt  

The ping result is “request timed out” because of the firewall setting on the VM:

  I will disable firewall on VM to able to ping from the desktop:

  Now, it's able to ping the Windows 10 VM and it is ready for Nessus scan:

# First Nessus scan 

 

Now I am going to scan VM through Nessus. 

Go to “create new scan” 

Select “basic network scan” 

Name: “Windows 10 Single Host” 

Targets: IP address of the VM windows 

Click “save”

  After saving, I am on “my scan”. Click launch to start scan:

  After scan is finished:

  There are not many vulnerabilities because I did not provide credentials and was not scanning authenticated scan. 
  The Nessus was not able to authenticate directly to the remote target because I did not provide any credentials for this VM.
  
  Next, I am going to setup VM to be able to accept authenticated scans and then provide some credentials to Nessus and rescan the VM. 
  
  # Accept authenticated scan and provide credentials to Nessus
  
First, enable remote registry because it allows the Nessus scanner to connect to the VM computer’s registry and can scan insecure configurations:

  Next, enable file and printer sharing:

  Disable user account control setting, so it will not notify me:
